# Contribution guide

If you're interested in contributing to this project, great! This file should help you get started.

## Types of contribution

There are many ways you can help improve this repository. For example:

- **Write a brand-new example:** for example, you might notice that there are no
  examples for a particular function.
- **Improve an existing example:** for example,
  you might notice a problem with an existing example, or some way it could be made more helpful.
- **Fix a bug:** we have a list of issues,
  or maybe you found your own.
- **Implement a new feature:** there are plenty of features planned.

## General guidance

- All new changes should have tests. You may find that some older functionality doesn't have any tests, so please feel free to add them!
- You should include an example of how to use the functionality you've added, or update the old examples for functionality you've changed.
- We don't have any consistency set up yet (this is in the pipeline), but it would be ideal to try and match the current code.
- When creating PRs, ensure that you describe your changes and why they were made.
